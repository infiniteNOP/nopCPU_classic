This is a simple 8-bit CPU I designed in order to learn Verilog.

It is licensed under the LGPL license. For more information, read the COPYING
file.

(One exception is the testbench, which is licensed under the ISC license.)

TODO:

        - Document it (Partially done. See the HACKING file.)
        - Write an assembler for it
